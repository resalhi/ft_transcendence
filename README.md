-Project Overview:
The Mighty Pong Contest website was conceptualized to provide a dynamic platform for enthusiasts of the classic game Pong to come together, compete, and celebrate their passion for gaming. Our goal was to design a user-friendly interface that captures the essence of the game while incorporating modern features to enhance the overall experience.

-Registration and Profile Management: Users can easily manage their profiles, including updating personal information and tracking game statistics.

-Interactive Gameplay: Leveraging cutting-edge technology, we implemented an interactive gameplay feature that allows users to compete against each other online in real-time, fostering a sense of competition within the gaming community.

-Social communication: The website includes channels (chat rooms) where players can connect, share tips, and engage in discussions, fostering a vibrant and supportive community enables users to share their experiences and achievements with friends.
